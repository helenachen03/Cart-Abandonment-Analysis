**Subject**: New task from the marketing team 

Hey!

I have an analysis task for you from the marketing team. You can see the background and request in the email below. There is the chance for us to have a big impact on the company direction in this project especially with the changes coming to the types of cars we can sell. 

I would like you to perform the analysis and write a short report for me. I don’t need to see any code, but I do want to read your thinking and how you got to your conclusions. I also want you to prepare and deliver the presentation for the marketing team - you are ready for the challenge!

You can find more details about what I expect you to do here. And information on the data here.   

I will be on vacation for the next couple of weeks, but I know you can do this without my support. If you need to make any decisions, include them in your work and I will review them when I am back. 

Good Luck!

Hi, 

Thanks for the previous work you did for us, it was really helpful and the recommendations have really improved our way of working. After that success, I have a new project for your team!

I am sure you have heard that by 2030 we are only going to be able to sell Electric vehicles here in the UK. We want to run some campaigns to promote used Electric cars. We know that in the last year we haven’t sold any electric cars, so we want to know about hybrids to give us some ideas. We want to know anything you can tell us about how the sales differ between hybrid and other types from sales over the last six months. 

We know that there are less hybrid cars for sale. We think they are more expensive, so we need to make them more appealing. We think hybrid could be a good way to get buyers to think about more environmentally friendly cars. 

Our goal is to increase the number of sales of hybrid and electric cars next year. 

We want to get moving on this campaign as soon as possible to beat our competitors so the sooner you can share some insights the better. 
 
Look forward to seeing your presentation.

## About Discount Motors

Discount Motors is a used car dealership in the UK. They want to lead the way in used cars. Selling to customers who want the latest and greatest features, without the price tag of a brand new car. 

The UK Government has now announced that from 2030 all new cars will be required to be zero emissions. Although this won’t impact the used car market, it is expected that buyers will give more consideration to the future value of their cars. And petrol and diesel will likely have a much lower value after 2030.

## UK Used Car Sales

The details in the data reflect the information given to potential buyers in the website adverts. 

Buyers typically want to know the road tax of a used car, which varies based on a combination of year registered, emissions and fuel type, with Electric cars currently exempt from road tax.

## Data Information

The marketing team has provided some data from the website listings from the last six months. We know that all of the cars in this data sold. I think there is a lot of information missing that could be useful to us.   

You can download the data from here. I will let you decide how to process it, just make sure you include all your decisions in your report.

The data hasn’t been validated, so make sure that you check it against all of the information in the table before you start your analysis.
