# Project - Cart Abandonment Analysis

The Cart Abandon Analysis project is aimed at analyzing and understanding customer behavior in the context of abandoned shopping carts. By generating relevant data using Python and performing comprehensive analysis, this project provides valuable insights into customer purchase patterns and identifies factors contributing to cart abandonment.

## Project Overview

This project aims to tackle the prevalent issue of cart abandonment in e-commerce by generating a realistic dataset using Python libraries such as `Faker`, `Pandas`, and `datetime`. The dataset will encompass diverse cart quantities, increasing total prices, consistent single-item timestamps, multiple item categories, and intentionally introduced missing values and inconsistencies. Through thorough analysis using `Pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `scipy`, we will explore the relationship between variables and identify the four primary factors behind high cart abandonment rates. The project will culminate in a comprehensive data generation and analysis report, offering valuable insights and actionable patterns to address cart abandonment in the e-commerce domain.
