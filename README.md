# Project - Cart Abandonment Analysis

The Cart Abandon Analysis project is aimed at analyzing and understanding customer behavior in the context of abandoned shopping carts. By generating relevant data using Python and performing comprehensive analysis, this project provides valuable insights into customer purchase patterns and identifies factors contributing to cart abandonment.

## Project Overview

Cart abandonment is a common occurrence in e-commerce, where customers add items to their carts but fail to complete the purchase. This project aims to shed light on this phenomenon by leveraging Python libraries such as `Faker`, `Pandas`, and `datetime` to generate a realistic dataset. The generated data incorporates specific requirements, including varying cart quantities, increasing total prices, consistent single-item timestamps, multiple item categories, and intentionally introduced missing values and inconsistencies.
